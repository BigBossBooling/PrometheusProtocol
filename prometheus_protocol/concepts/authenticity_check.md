# Prometheus Protocol: "Authenticity Check" Concepts

This document outlines conceptual ideas for how Prometheus Protocol can support principles of content authenticity and transparency in AI-generated content. The focus is on features within Prometheus Protocol that can aid users in creating more verifiable outputs and on metadata logging that could support downstream authenticity verification processes.

## I. Goals of "Authenticity Check" Conceptualization

1.  **Promote Transparent Prompting:** Explore features that guide users to craft prompts which encourage AI models (like "Jules") to generate responses that are more transparent about their sources, reasoning, or inherent assumptions.
2.  **Facilitate Provenance (Conceptual):** Identify metadata that Prometheus Protocol can log about the prompt engineering and AI generation process. This metadata could conceptually contribute to a provenance chain if integrated with external authenticity systems or standards.
3.  **Aid User Disclosure:** Conceptualize tools that can help users generate appropriate disclosure statements when they intend to use AI-generated content, indicating the nature of AI involvement.
4.  **Raise User Awareness:** Integrate elements into the UI and workflow that make users more aware of authenticity considerations in the context of AI content generation.
5.  **Align with Responsible AI Principles:** Ensure that Prometheus Protocol's design philosophically aligns with broader efforts to foster trust and verifiability in AI-generated information.

## II. Scope for V1 Concepts

For this initial conceptualization (V1 Concepts), the focus will be on:

1.  **Guidance through Prompting Features:** Brainstorming new "Creative Catalyst" module ideas and "Risk Identifier" rules that encourage users to ask for more verifiable AI outputs.
2.  **Metadata Logging by Prometheus Protocol:** Defining what specific information about the prompt, its execution, and the AI's response Prometheus Protocol itself could log internally. This data would be *potentially useful* for future, external authenticity verification but Prometheus Protocol will not perform the verification itself.
3.  **Disclosure Assistance Tools (Conceptual):** Ideas for helping users draft statements about AI involvement in their content.
4.  **Conceptual UI Elements:** Brief mentions of how these features might be surfaced to the user.

**Out of Scope for V1 Concepts (Future Considerations or External Systems):**

*   **Implementation of Cryptographic Watermarking:** Prometheus Protocol will not be conceptualized to embed its own digital watermarks (perceptible or imperceptible like SynthID) into content. This is assumed to be a capability of the AI model (Jules) or separate, specialized tools.
*   **Direct Integration with External Verification Services/APIs:** While we aim for compatibility, V1 concepts will not include direct API calls to external authenticity verification platforms or C2PA manifest generation tools.
*   **Content Analysis for Authenticity Markers:** Prometheus Protocol will not analyze AI-generated content to detect watermarks or assess its authenticity score. This is the role of verifier tools.
*   **Legal or Policy Enforcement:** Prometheus Protocol will provide guidance and tools, but not enforce legal or specific organizational policies regarding content authenticity (beyond its own content moderation if applicable to prompts themselves).

*Next sections will summarize key authenticity principles, brainstorm features, conceptualize metadata, and discuss disclosure assistance.*

## III. Summary of Key Content Authenticity Principles

To understand how Prometheus Protocol can best support content authenticity, it's helpful to be aware of the core principles behind major initiatives in this space. These initiatives aim to provide ways to understand the origin (provenance) and history of digital content.

### A. C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)

*   **Core Idea:** C2PA focuses on providing **provenance** for digital content. It aims to allow creators and editors to make assertions about who created a piece of content, what tools were used, and what modifications were made.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Manifests:** C2PA defines a way to embed a "manifest" of information directly within a digital asset (image, video, audio, document).
    *   **Cryptographic Assertions:** This manifest contains cryptographically signed assertions about the content's lifecycle. Each entity (creator, editing tool, AI model platform) involved in the content's creation or modification can add its own signed assertion.
    *   **Ingredients:** The manifest can also link to "ingredients" – other assets that were used to create the current one – allowing for a traceable history.
*   **Information Captured (Examples):**
    *   Who created it (person, organization).
    *   What tools were used (e.g., "Adobe Photoshop," "Generative AI Model X by Company Y").
    *   What actions were performed (e.g., "created," "edited," "transcoded," "AI-generated portions").
    *   Timestamps for these actions.
*   **Goal:** To provide a verifiable trail that allows consumers to make more informed judgments about the authenticity and trustworthiness of content. It doesn't inherently say if content is "true" or "false," but rather provides evidence about its origin and modifications.

### B. Google's SynthID (and similar AI-specific approaches)

*   **Core Idea (for SynthID as an example of AI-specific techniques):** SynthID, specifically for AI-generated images from Google's models, focuses on embedding a **digital watermark** directly into the pixels of an image in a way that is designed to be imperceptible to the human eye but detectable by a corresponding model/algorithm.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Watermarking at Generation:** The watermark is applied by the generative AI model itself *at the time of image creation*.
    *   **Resilience:** Designed to be somewhat resilient to common image manipulations like compression, resizing, cropping, and color changes, though not perfectly immune to all adversarial attacks.
    *   **Detection:** A separate tool or model is used to detect the presence (or absence) of this specific watermark, indicating whether the image was likely generated by a participating AI model.
*   **Information Conveyed:** Primarily, the presence of the watermark signals that the content is AI-generated by a model that participates in this watermarking scheme. It doesn't typically carry detailed provenance like C2PA manifests (e.g., specific prompt used, user ID) directly within the watermark itself, though such information might be logged separately by the AI service provider.
*   **Goal:** To provide a means of identifying AI-generated content, helping to distinguish it from non-AI-generated content, which can be crucial for transparency.

### C. Relevance to Prometheus Protocol

Prometheus Protocol itself will **not** implement C2PA manifest creation or SynthID-style watermarking. However, understanding these principles helps us conceptualize:
*   **Prompting for Transparency:** How users can be guided to ask Jules for outputs that are inherently more verifiable or transparent (e.g., asking for sources, reasoning).
*   **Metadata Logging:** What metadata Prometheus Protocol can log during the prompt engineering and Jules execution process that *could be useful if a user later wishes to create a C2PA manifest* using other tools, or that could complement information from a SynthID-style system. For example, logging the exact `PromptObject` (or its hash) used for a generation event.
*   **Disclosure:** How Prometheus Protocol can assist users in creating appropriate disclosures about their use of AI.

By focusing on these areas, Prometheus Protocol can be a responsible component in a broader ecosystem of tools and standards aimed at fostering content authenticity.

*Next sections will brainstorm specific features within Prometheus Protocol.*

## IV. Features to Encourage AI Transparency via Prompt Engineering

Prometheus Protocol can empower users to request more transparent and verifiable outputs from AI models like Jules by offering specialized guidance and tools during the prompt creation phase.

### A. New "Creative Catalyst" Module Idea: "Transparency Request Suggester"

*   **Module Name:** Transparency Request Suggester
*   **Purpose:** To provide users with readily available phrases and constraint ideas that explicitly ask the AI to be more transparent about its generation process, sources, assumptions, or limitations.
*   **Integration:** Accessible via the Creative Catalyst hub or contextually when the user is crafting the `task` or `constraints` for a `PromptObject`.
*   **Conceptual User Input:**
    *   The current `PromptObject.task` and/or `PromptObject.context`.
    *   User might select a "type" of transparency they are interested in (e.g., "Source Citation," "Reasoning Steps," "Assumption Disclosure," "Confidence Level").
*   **Conceptual Output/Interaction:**
    *   A list of suggested phrases or questions that can be added to the prompt's task or as constraints.
    *   **Examples of Suggestions:**
        *   **For Source Citation:**
            *   "Please cite your primary sources for any factual claims."
            *   "Provide URLs or references for the information presented."
            *   "If you use information from a specific document I provided in the context, please indicate which part."
        *   **For Reasoning Steps:**
            *   "Explain your reasoning step-by-step."
            *   "Show your work."
            *   "Describe the process you used to arrive at this answer."
        *   **For Assumption Disclosure:**
            *   "If you are making any assumptions to answer this, please state them clearly."
            *   "What implicit assumptions are embedded in your response?"
        *   **For Confidence Level / Alternatives:**
            *   "Indicate your confidence level in this answer (e.g., high, medium, low)."
            *   "Are there alternative viewpoints or solutions to this? If so, briefly mention them."
            *   "What are the known limitations of this information or approach?"
        *   **For AI Identification (if user wants AI to self-disclose):**
            *   "Please start your response by stating you are an AI assistant." (Use with caution, as model capabilities/policies vary).
*   **User Action:** User can click to copy/insert these suggestions into their prompt.

### B. New "Risk Identifier" Rule Idea: `RiskType.POTENTIAL_OPAQUENESS`

*   **Risk Type Name:** `POTENTIAL_OPAQUENESS`
*   **Purpose:** To flag prompts that request factual information, analysis, advice, or other outputs where transparency about sources, reasoning, or confidence would be highly beneficial for trustworthiness, yet the prompt lacks constraints encouraging such transparency.
*   **Logic (Conceptual):**
    *   **Trigger Conditions:**
        *   The `PromptObject.task` contains keywords indicative of factual queries, analytical requests, or advisory content (e.g., "explain why," "summarize the facts," "what is the evidence for," "recommend a course of action," "analyze the impact of").
        *   AND `PromptObject.constraints` list *lacks* any common transparency-promoting phrases (e.g., does not contain "source", "cite", "reasoning", "evidence", "assumption", "confidence level", "disclose").
    *   **Risk Level:** `INFO` or `WARNING`.
    *   **Message:** "This prompt requests factual or analytical output but lacks constraints for transparency (e.g., asking for sources, reasoning, or assumptions). Consider adding such constraints to encourage a more verifiable and trustworthy AI response. The 'Transparency Request Suggester' catalyst can help."
    *   **Offending Field:** `constraints` (as it's the lack of them) or `task` (as it sets the expectation).
*   **Integration:** This risk would appear in the Risk Identifier panel/feedback in the `PromptObject` Editor UI, guiding the user to consider adding transparency constraints.

### C. UI Concept: "Best Practices for Transparent Prompts" Guide

*   **Element:** A link, button, or small, non-intrusive "?" icon within the `PromptObject` editor (perhaps near the `task` or `constraints` section).
*   **Content:** Leads to a (static for V1) help page or modal window that provides:
    *   A brief explanation of why transparency in AI responses is important.
    *   Examples of effective phrases to include in prompts to request citations, reasoning, assumption disclosure, etc.
    *   Tips on how to critically evaluate AI responses even when they cite sources.
*   **Purpose:** Educates users proactively and provides readily accessible guidance.

By integrating these features, Prometheus Protocol can actively assist users in crafting prompts that are more likely to yield transparent, verifiable, and ultimately more trustworthy AI-generated content.

## V. Metadata Logging by Prometheus Protocol for Authenticity Support

Beyond guiding prompt creation, Prometheus Protocol can automatically log metadata related to the prompt engineering and AI generation lifecycle. This logged information, while internal to Prometheus Protocol's backend or user's project data, could serve as a valuable part of a "digital paper trail" if a user needs to trace the provenance of an AI-generated output or provide data to an external C2PA-compliant tool or verifier.

Prometheus Protocol would **not** embed this directly into AI output (unless specifically instructed by a prompt to Jules), but would maintain it as associated metadata.

### A. Key Metadata to Log Per AI Interaction (`AIResponse` or associated log)

Much of this is already captured or planned for the `AIResponse` object or could be part of an extended internal logging structure associated with each `AIResponse` or generation event.

1.  **`prometheus_version` (str):**
    *   **Description:** The version of the Prometheus Protocol platform/software used to craft the prompt and orchestrate the AI call.
    *   **Rationale:** Tool versioning is a common part of provenance information.

2.  **`prompt_object_snapshot_hash` (str):**
    *   **Description:** A cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the complete `PromptObject` (as serialized by `to_dict()`) that was sent to the `JulesExecutor` for the specific generation event.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures an immutable record of the exact prompt used, even if the source `PromptObject` template is later modified or deleted. This is crucial for precise provenance. The full snapshot could also be stored but is larger.

3.  **`jules_request_payload_snapshot_hash` (str):** (Conceptual, if different from `prompt_object_snapshot_hash` due to further processing)
    *   **Description:** A hash of the actual JSON payload sent to the hypothetical Jules API (as prepared by `JulesExecutor._prepare_jules_request_payload`).
    *   **Rationale:** Captures the exact data sent to the AI, including any model parameters or history formatting applied by the executor.

4.  **Linkage IDs (already in `AIResponse`):**
    *   `source_prompt_id`, `source_prompt_version`, `source_conversation_id`, `source_turn_id`, `jules_request_id_client`, `jules_request_id_jules`.
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for linking the AI output back to its origins within Prometheus Protocol and the AI service.

5.  **Timestamps (already in `AIResponse`):**
    *   `timestamp_request_sent`, `timestamp_response_received`.
    *   **Rationale:** Core temporal information for the generation event.

6.  **Execution Settings Snapshot (Conceptual - could be part of `raw_jules_response` or logged separately):**
    *   **Description:** Key settings used for the Jules API call if not already fully in `prompt_object_snapshot_hash` (e.g., specific model version selected if dynamic, temperature, max_tokens if overridden at execution time).
    *   **Rationale:** Parameters influencing generation are vital for provenance. `AIResponse.jules_model_used` already captures part of this.

7.  **`ai_response_content_hash` (str):**
    *   **Description:** A hash of the `AIResponse.content` (the main textual output from Jules).
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a way to verify if the stored/displayed AI content matches what was originally received, useful if content is later copied and potentially altered outside Prometheus Protocol.

### B. User and Session Information (Conceptual - for systems with user accounts)

If Prometheus Protocol were a multi-user system:

1.  **`user_id` (str):**
    *   **Description:** Identifier of the user who initiated the AI generation.
    *   **Rationale:** "Creator" information is fundamental to C2PA-style provenance.
2.  **`session_id` (str):**
    *   **Description:** An identifier for the user's session during which the generation occurred.
    *   **Rationale:** Can help group related activities.

### C. Storage and Accessibility of Logged Metadata

*   This metadata would be stored securely in Prometheus Protocol's backend database, associated with the `AIResponse` records or as separate audit logs.
*   **Conceptual Feature (V2+):** A user could potentially "Export Provenance Data" for a specific `AIResponse`. This export could be a JSON or XML file containing the relevant logged metadata, which the user could then (manually or via other tools) incorporate into a C2PA manifest or use for their own record-keeping.

By logging this type of metadata, Prometheus Protocol can provide a strong foundation for users who need to document the provenance of their AI-assisted content creation processes.

## VI. Disclosure Generation Assistance (Conceptual UI)

As part of promoting transparency, Prometheus Protocol can assist users in generating simple disclosure statements to accompany AI-generated or AI-assisted content they create. This helps inform end-consumers about the nature of the content's origin.

### A. New "Creative Catalyst" Module Idea: "Disclosure Statement Suggester"

*   **Module Name:** Disclosure Statement Suggester
*   **Purpose:** To provide users with contextually relevant, template-based suggestions for disclosure statements regarding AI involvement in content creation.
*   **Integration:**
    *   Accessible via the Creative Catalyst hub.
    *   More prominently, a button like **"[Suggest Disclosure]"** could appear in the `AIResponse` display panel (within the `PromptObject` Editor or the `Conversation Composer`'s "Selected Turn Detail Panel") *after* an AI response has been generated and displayed.
*   **Conceptual User Input (Implicit or Explicit):**
    *   The `PromptObject` used (especially `role` and `task`).
    *   The generated `AIResponse.content` (or characteristics of it, e.g., its length, whether it's presented as factual vs. fictional).
    *   (V2) User might select "Nature of AI assistance" (e.g., "Brainstorming," "Drafting," "Editing," "Full Generation").
*   **Conceptual Output/Interaction:**
    *   A list of suggested disclosure phrases or short statements.
    *   The suggestions could vary based on the perceived nature of the AI's contribution or the type of content.
    *   **Examples of Suggested Disclosures:**
        *   **General Assistance:**
            *   "This content was created with the assistance of an AI tool ([Prometheus Protocol/Google Jules])."
            *   "AI was used to help brainstorm and draft portions of this text."
        *   **For Factual-Sounding Content (if not heavily verified by user):**
            *   "This explanation was generated by an AI and has not been independently fact-checked. Please verify critical information."
            *   "AI-generated summary. Original sources should be consulted for full context."
        *   **For Creative Works:**
            *   "This story/poem/script is a work of fiction created with AI assistance."
            *   "The following dialogue was collaboratively written with an AI."
        *   **If User Heavily Edited AI Output:**
            *   "This text was initially drafted with AI assistance and significantly revised by the author."
    *   **User Action:** User can click a suggestion to copy it to their clipboard, making it easy to paste into their document, website, or publication.

### B. Customization and User Responsibility

*   **Editable Suggestions:** While Prometheus Protocol can suggest statements, the user should be able to easily edit or customize them before use.
*   **User Responsibility:** The UI should make it clear that these are *suggestions* and the user is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of any disclosure they make, in accordance with relevant platform policies or ethical guidelines. Prometheus Protocol is an assistive tool, not a legal advisor for disclosure requirements.

By providing such a feature, Prometheus Protocol can lower the barrier for users to include responsible disclosures, contributing to a more transparent information ecosystem.
