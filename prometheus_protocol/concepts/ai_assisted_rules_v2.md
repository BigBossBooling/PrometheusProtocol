# Prometheus Protocol: V2 Concepts - AI-Assisted GIGO & Risk Rule Management

This document outlines conceptual ideas for a V2+ feature in Prometheus Protocol: leveraging Artificial Intelligence to assist in the generation, refinement, and management of rules for the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) Guardrail and the Risk Identifier systems.

## 1. Goals, Scope, and Guiding Principles

### 1.1. Goals

The primary goals for AI-Assisted GIGO & Risk Rule Management are:

1.  **Enhance Rule Effectiveness:** Improve the accuracy, coverage, and relevance of GIGO and Risk rules by identifying patterns and insights from real usage data that human rule creators might miss or find time-consuming to discover.
2.  **Increase Adaptability:** Allow the GIGO and Risk identification systems to adapt more quickly to new prompting techniques, emerging AI model behaviors, or evolving community standards for responsible AI use.
3.  **Reduce Manual Rule Creation Burden:** Assist human administrators or "Rules Stewards" by suggesting potential new rules or modifications to existing ones, thereby streamlining the rule management lifecycle.
4.  **Data-Driven Rule Validation:** Provide a framework where the performance of existing rules can be assessed based on `OutputAnalytics`, and where AI can help identify underperforming or overly restrictive rules.
5.  **Proactive Guidance Improvement:** Ultimately, lead to better, more nuanced, and more timely guidance for users of Prometheus Protocol, helping them craft even higher quality and safer prompts.

### 1.2. Scope (V2 Concepts)

This V2 conceptualization will focus on:

*   **AI as an Assistant:** The AI's role is to provide suggestions, identify patterns, and support human decision-making in rule management. It is **not** about fully autonomous rule creation, deployment, or modification without human oversight and approval.
*   **Leveraging Platform Data:** Assumes the system has access to (potentially anonymized and aggregated) data from:
    *   `PromptObject`s (structure, content, tags).
    *   `AIResponse`s (content, errors, metadata).
    *   `AnalyticsEntry` data (user ratings, feedback tags, qualitative notes, usage flags).
    *   `PotentialRisk` occurrences and their correlation with analytics.
    *   `GIGO Guardrail` violation frequencies and patterns.
*   **Hypothetical "Analysis Model":** The AI performing this analysis is a conceptual "analysis model." Its specific architecture or how it's trained is out of scope for this document; we focus on *what* it would analyze and *what kind of suggestions* it might produce.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:** Defining the process by which AI suggestions are reviewed, validated, and implemented by human administrators.

**Out of Scope for this V2 Conceptualization:**

*   The specific machine learning model architecture or training process for the "analysis model."
*   Fully autonomous rule deployment by AI.
*   Real-time AI-driven rule updates without an admin review cycle (though suggestions could be generated in near real-time).

### 1.3. Guiding Principles

*   **Human Oversight is Key:** AI assists, humans validate and decide. All AI-suggested rule changes or additions must be reviewable and approvable by a human administrator/steward.
*   **Data-Driven Suggestions:** AI recommendations should be based on identifiable patterns and correlations within the platform's usage and feedback data. The "evidence" for a suggestion should be presentable.
*   **Transparency of AI Suggestions:** When a rule is suggested by AI, the basis for the suggestion should be as clear as possible to the human reviewer.
*   **Focus on Improvement:** The primary aim is to improve the helpfulness and accuracy of guidance given to end-users of Prometheus Protocol.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The AI-assisted system itself should be open to iterative improvement and tuning.

## 2. Data Sources for AI-Assisted Rule Analysis

For an AI system (the conceptual "analysis model") to effectively assist in generating and refining GIGO Guardrail and Risk Identifier rules, it would need access to various data points generated within Prometheus Protocol. This data provides insights into prompt quality, AI response characteristics, user satisfaction, and common issues encountered.

The primary data sources would include (assuming appropriate anonymization and aggregation where necessary for privacy if analyzing across multiple users):

1.  **`PromptObject` Data:**
    *   **Content & Structure:** The full content of all fields (`role`, `context`, `task`, `constraints`, `examples`, `tags`, `settings`).
    *   **Analysis Potential:** Identify common patterns in prompts that correlate with specific outcomes (good or bad). For example, are prompts with very few constraints often problematic? Do certain `settings` values correlate with higher risk scores or lower user ratings? Are prompts with many examples typically clearer?
    *   **Source:** `TemplateManager` (for saved templates), `ConversationManager` (for prompts within saved conversations), or logs of executed prompts.

2.  **`AIResponse` Data:**
    *   **Content:** The textual output from the Jules AI (`AIResponse.content`).
    *   **Metadata:** `jules_tokens_used`, `jules_finish_reason`, `jules_model_used`.
    *   **Error Information:** `AIResponse.was_successful`, `AIResponse.error_message`, `AIResponse.raw_jules_response` (especially the `error.code` from Jules).
    *   **Analysis Potential:**
        *   Correlate `jules_finish_reason` (e.g., "length", "content_filter") with specific prompt characteristics to suggest rules that might mitigate these issues (e.g., if "length" is common, suggest a "Max Tokens" constraint or a risk for overly broad tasks).
        *   Identify prompt patterns that frequently lead to specific Jules error codes (e.g., `JULES_ERR_CONTENT_POLICY_VIOLATION`), which could inform new `RiskIdentifier` rules or refine existing keyword watchlists.
        *   Analyze AI-generated `content` itself (V2+ advanced NLP) for characteristics that users then flag as negative in analytics (e.g., repetitive phrasing, factual inaccuracies if detectable, overly generic responses).

3.  **`AnalyticsEntry` Data (from `Output Analytics Concepts`):**
    *   **User Ratings:** `output_rating`, `output_clarity_rating`, `output_relevance_rating`.
    *   **User Tags:** `custom_tags` (e.g., "accurate," "creative," "needs_revision," "off-topic," "unsafe," "biased").
    *   **Flags:** `used_in_final_work`, `regeneration_count` (or similar metrics indicating user effort/satisfaction).
    *   **Qualitative Feedback:** `user_qualitative_feedback`.
    *   **Analysis Potential:** This is the most direct feedback on output quality.
        *   Correlate low ratings or negative tags with specific `PromptObject` structures, `PromptObject.settings`, or `RiskIdentifier` flags that were (or were not) present. This can directly suggest new GIGO/Risk rules or tune existing ones.
        *   For instance, if prompts missing example N (from a set of common examples for a task type) consistently get low `output_relevance_rating`, it might suggest a GIGO rule or a catalyst improvement.
        *   High `regeneration_count` for prompts with certain characteristics could indicate areas where GIGO/Risk guidance is insufficient.

4.  **`PotentialRisk` Occurrences (from `RiskIdentifier`):**
    *   **Data:** Logs of which `RiskType`s and `RiskLevel`s were triggered for which prompts.
    *   **Analysis Potential:**
        *   **Effectiveness of Risks:** Do prompts that trigger certain `RiskType.WARNING`s still frequently lead to poor `AnalyticsEntry` outcomes? If so, maybe the risk message needs to be stronger, the `RiskLevel` increased, or the GIGO rules made stricter to prevent the risky structure altogether.
        *   **False Positives (Conceptual V2):** If users could flag a `PotentialRisk` warning as "not applicable" or "helpful/unhelpful" (an advanced feedback mechanism), this data could be used to tune risk rules.

5.  **`GIGO Guardrail` Violation Data (from `validate_prompt`):**
    *   **Data:** Logs of which specific `PromptValidationError` types are most frequently encountered by users.
    *   **Analysis Potential:**
        *   Identify the most common mistakes users make in prompt construction. This could inform UI improvements in the `PromptObject` Editor, better help text, or highlight areas where "Creative Catalyst" modules could be most effective.
        *   If a GIGO rule is very frequently triggered but users seem to bypass or ignore it leading to poor `OutputAnalytics`, it might indicate the rule itself is unclear or its advice is not actionable enough.

By processing and correlating these diverse data sources, the "analysis model" could uncover valuable patterns to inform the continuous improvement of Prometheus Protocol's guidance systems. The linkage provided by IDs (`prompt_id`, `version`, `conversation_id`, `turn_id`, `response_id`, `entry_id`) across these data structures is essential for this correlational analysis.

## 3. AI-Assisted GIGO Guardrail Rule Management (V2 Concepts)

The GIGO Guardrail (`core.guardrails.validate_prompt`) is fundamental for ensuring basic prompt quality. An AI "analysis model" could assist in evolving these rules by identifying patterns that lead to problematic prompts or user friction, even if those prompts pass current GIGO checks but then perform poorly based on analytics or require frequent user correction.

### 3.1. Suggesting New GIGO Rules from Usage Patterns

*   **Methodology:** The analysis model would look for correlations between specific structural characteristics of `PromptObject`s (that are *not* currently flagged by GIGO rules) and negative outcomes or user behaviors indicated in `AnalyticsEntry` data.
*   **Examples of AI-Driven Suggestions:**
    1.  **Overly Long Single Fields:**
        *   **Observation:** Prompts where `PromptObject.context` or `PromptObject.task` exceed a certain character/word count (e.g., >1000 words in `context` without clear structuring) frequently correlate with low `output_clarity_rating` or high `regeneration_count`.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "Consider a new GIGO WARNING rule: 'Context is very long (X words). For better AI comprehension, consider summarizing or structuring with headings/bullets if applicable.' Threshold: X=1000 words."
    2.  **High Number of Constraints/Examples without Grouping/Structure:**
        *   **Observation:** Prompts with a very high number of individual `constraints` or `examples` (e.g., >15 items) without apparent thematic grouping (this part is harder for AI to detect simply) might correlate with user feedback tags like "confusing_instructions" or "AI_ignored_some_points."
        *   **AI Suggestion (Simpler V1):** "Consider a new GIGO INFO rule: 'High number of constraints (X items). Ensure they are all distinct and clearly phrased. Consider grouping related constraints if possible.' Threshold: X=15."
        *   **AI Suggestion (More Advanced V2 with NLP):** The AI might identify clusters of similar constraints and suggest grouping them or rephrasing for clarity.
    3.  **Specific Phrasing Leading to Frequent `UnresolvedPlaceholderError` (User Behavior):**
        *   **Observation:** Although `UnresolvedPlaceholderError` *is* a GIGO error, if users *frequently* use a *new, unrecognized* placeholder pattern (e.g., "%%%VARIABLE_NAME%%%") that our current regexes miss, and then have to manually correct it (indicated perhaps by quick re-saves or specific feedback), the AI could detect this recurring pattern.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "Pattern '%%%...%%% ' frequently appears and seems to be used as a placeholder. Consider adding this pattern to the `UnresolvedPlaceholderError` detection logic in `core.guardrails.py`."

### 3.2. Refining Existing GIGO Rule Parameters or Messages

*   **Methodology:** Analyze the impact and user reception of existing GIGO rules.
*   **Examples of AI-Driven Refinements:**
    1.  **Effectiveness of a Rule:**
        *   **Observation:** The `RepetitiveListItemError` is frequently triggered for the `tags` field of `PromptObject`, but users often proceed without changing them, and `OutputAnalytics` show no negative impact for prompts with these "repetitive" tags.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "The `RepetitiveListItemError` for the 'tags' field has a high trigger rate but low correlation with negative output analytics. Consider lowering its severity (e.g., to an INFO-level `PotentialRisk` instead of a GIGO error) or removing the check for 'tags' specifically."
    2.  **Clarity of Error Messages (Conceptual V2 - requires user feedback on errors):**
        *   **Observation:** If a hypothetical V2 feature allowed users to rate GIGO error messages themselves (e.g., "Was this GIGO alert helpful?"), the AI could analyze this. If a specific error message is frequently marked "unhelpful," despite being technically correct.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "The error message for `MissingRequiredFieldError` on 'Context' is often rated unhelpful. Current message: 'Context: Must be a non-empty string.' Consider rephrasing for more guidance, e.g., 'Context: Please provide background information. Leaving this empty can lead to less relevant AI responses.'"

### 3.3. Identifying GIGO Rules That Are No Longer Needed

*   **Methodology:** Over time, as AI models (Jules) evolve, some prompt structures that were previously problematic (and thus have GIGO rules) might become well-handled by newer model versions.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Observation:** A GIGO rule exists to prevent extremely short tasks (e.g., less than 3 words) because old models struggled. However, `OutputAnalytics` for a new Jules model version show that prompts with 1-2 word tasks (when context is rich) now perform very well and have high user satisfaction. The GIGO rule is still flagging these, causing user friction.
    *   **AI Suggestion:** "The GIGO rule for 'Task too short (less than 3 words)' appears to be overly restrictive with the current primary Jules model version (based on analytics of successfully run short prompts). Consider removing or adjusting the threshold for this rule."

The AI's role here is to act as a data analyst, highlighting statistical correlations and potential areas for improvement to the human Rules Steward, who would then investigate and make the final decision on rule changes.

## 4. AI-Assisted Risk Rule Management (V2 Concepts)

The `RiskIdentifier` component plays a crucial role in guiding users towards safer, more ethical, and effective prompts by flagging potential issues that go beyond simple syntax. An AI "analysis model" can significantly enhance this system by identifying subtle patterns and correlations that suggest new risks or refinements to existing risk detection rules.

### 4.1. Suggesting New Risk Types or Rules

*   **Methodology:** The analysis model would mine `PromptObject` content, `AIResponse` characteristics (especially errors or content flagged by users), and `AnalyticsEntry` data (low ratings, specific negative `custom_tags`, qualitative feedback) to find correlations that indicate unaddressed potential risks.
*   **Examples of AI-Driven Suggestions for New Risks:**
    1.  **Identifying Patterns Leading to Biased-Sounding Outputs:**
        *   **Observation:** The AI analyzes `user_qualitative_feedback` and `custom_tags` (e.g., "biased," "stereotypical") from `AnalyticsEntry` data. It finds that prompts containing certain combinations of keywords in `context` (e.g., specific demographic terms) and `task` (e.g., "describe typical traits of X group"), without explicit counter-biasing constraints, frequently receive these negative flags.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "New `RiskType.POTENTIAL_BIAS` (Level: WARNING): Prompts targeting demographic groups for trait descriptions without strong 'avoid stereotypes' or 'ensure balanced perspective' constraints correlate with user-flagged biased outputs. Consider a rule to detect [specific keyword patterns + lack of counter-bias constraint]."
    2.  **Detecting Overly Broad Requests Prone to Hallucination/Fabrication:**
        *   **Observation:** Prompts with very open-ended tasks (e.g., "Tell me everything about X obscure topic") combined with few constraints and high `PromptObject.settings['temperature']` (if tracked with analytics) often correlate with `AnalyticsEntry` tags like "inaccurate," "made_stuff_up," or low `output_relevance_rating`.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "New `RiskType.HIGH_HALLUCINATION_POTENTIAL` (Level: WARNING): Open-ended factual queries on niche topics with high creativity settings and few constraints show correlation with user-flagged inaccuracies. Suggest flagging prompts with [task keyword patterns + high temperature + low constraint count]."
    3.  **Unintended Consequence Identification from `conversation_history` Patterns:**
        *   **Observation (V2+ with conversation context analysis):** In multi-turn `Conversation` analytics, certain sequences of user prompts and AI responses lead to the conversation derailing or the AI adopting an undesirable stance in later turns.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "New `RiskType.CONVERSATION_DERAILMENT_PATTERN` (Level: INFO/WARNING): The sequence [User prompt pattern A -> AI response pattern B -> User prompt pattern C] has been observed to lead to off-topic or problematic AI behavior in later turns X% of the time. Consider a risk warning if this conversational prefix is detected."

### 4.2. Refining Parameters of Existing Risk Rules

*   **Methodology:** Analyze the effectiveness and user reception of currently defined `RiskType`s and their associated detection logic.
*   **Examples of AI-Driven Refinements:**
    1.  **Tuning `KEYWORD_WATCH` Lists and Severity:**
        *   **Observation:** The `KEYWORD_WATCH` for "sensitive_medical_advice" is triggered, but `OutputAnalytics` for these prompts (when users proceed) show very high user satisfaction and "accurate" tags, especially if specific disclaimers *were* included as constraints (even if not the *exact* ones the AI might look for to suppress the warning).
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "Review `KEYWORD_WATCH` for 'sensitive_medical_advice'. It has a high trigger rate but often correlates with positive outcomes *if* constraints like 'for informational purposes only' or 'consult a professional' are present. Consider refining the rule to only trigger if such disclaimers are *absent*, or lower its default `RiskLevel` if such constraints are common good practice by users."
        *   **Observation:** Users frequently provide feedback (`custom_tags` or `user_qualitative_feedback`) about a new type of sensitive topic (e.g., "AI discussing self-awareness") that isn't on any current watchlist but is causing user concern.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "Consider adding 'AI self-awareness,' 'AI consciousness' to a `KEYWORD_WATCH` list (Level: INFO/WARNING) due to recurrent user concerns in qualitative feedback when these topics appear without careful framing."
    2.  **Adjusting `RiskLevel` Based on Actual Impact:**
        *   **Observation:** `RiskType.LACK_OF_SPECIFICITY` is currently a `RiskLevel.WARNING`. However, analytics show that when this risk is flagged, and users *ignore* it, their `output_rating` is drastically lower (e.g., >75% of the time) compared to when they address it.
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "Consider elevating `RiskType.LACK_OF_SPECIFICITY` from `RiskLevel.WARNING` to `RiskLevel.CRITICAL` (or a stronger WARNING with more insistent UI) due to strong correlation with poor outcomes when ignored."
    3.  **Improving Risk Messages for Actionability:**
        *   **Observation (V2+ with feedback on risk messages):** If users could indicate if a risk warning was helpful or if they understood how to address it. If a certain risk message is consistently marked "unclear."
        *   **AI Suggestion:** "The message for `RiskType.UNCONSTRAINED_GENERATION` is often marked 'unclear.' Current: [...]. Consider rephrasing to: 'This complex task could benefit from more specific limits. Try adding constraints for: [suggest 2-3 common constraint types like output length, format, or key points to include/exclude].'" The AI could even learn which constraint *types* are most helpful for given task types.

The AI here acts as a sophisticated data scientist, identifying correlations and anomalies that human rule maintainers might miss, thereby enabling a more adaptive and effective risk mitigation system. As always, human oversight (Section 5) is crucial for validating and implementing these AI-driven suggestions.

## 5. Human-in-the-Loop Workflow & Conceptual UI for AI-Assisted Rule Management (V2)

For AI-assisted GIGO and Risk rule management to be effective and trustworthy, a robust human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow is essential. The AI acts as a powerful analytical tool, surfacing patterns and making suggestions, but human administrators or designated "Rules Stewards" must be responsible for reviewing, validating, refining, and ultimately deploying any changes to the rule sets.

### 5.1. Workflow for Reviewing and Implementing AI-Suggested Rule Changes

1.  **Suggestion Generation:** The AI "analysis model" periodically processes platform data (as outlined in Section 2) and generates a list of potential new rules or modifications to existing GIGO Guardrail or Risk Identifier rules. Each suggestion should be accompanied by:
    *   The proposed rule logic/parameters.
    *   The data/evidence that led to the suggestion (e.g., "X% of prompts with characteristic Y had Z negative outcome").
    *   The AI's confidence in the suggestion (if available).
    *   Potential impact assessment (e.g., "This rule might affect N% of existing saved prompts").

2.  **Presentation to Human Stewards:** These suggestions are presented to human stewards via a dedicated interface (see Conceptual UI below).

3.  **Human Review and Triage:** Stewards review each suggestion:
    *   **Understand Rationale:** Examine the evidence provided by the AI.
    *   **Assess Validity:** Determine if the suggestion is sensible, aligns with platform goals, and doesn't have obvious unintended negative consequences.
    *   **Prioritize:** Decide which suggestions warrant further action based on potential impact and confidence.

4.  **Refinement and Testing (Iterative):**
    *   Stewards can refine the AI's suggested rule parameters or messages.
    *   **Crucially, new or modified rules must be tested** against a corpus of existing (anonymized) prompts and their known outcomes (if available from analytics) to estimate:
        *   **Efficacy:** Does it catch the intended issues?
        *   **False Positive Rate:** Does it incorrectly flag good prompts?
        *   **Impact on User Experience:** Is the rule understandable and actionable?
    *   This testing might involve running the proposed rule in a "shadow mode" (logging its hypothetical triggers without showing them to users) or on a dedicated test set.

5.  **Deployment:**
    *   Approved and tested rules are deployed into the live GIGO Guardrail or Risk Identifier system.
    *   This might involve updating configuration files for these components or, if rules are stored in a database (V2+), updating the rule definitions there.

6.  **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:**
    *   After deployment, the performance of the new/modified rule is monitored using `OutputAnalytics` and user feedback (if any on the rule's message).
    *   This data feeds back into the AI "analysis model," allowing for further refinement or even suggestions to retract or modify rules that aren't performing well.

### 5.2. Conceptual "Rule Management Dashboard" UI

A dedicated administrative UI would be needed for Rules Stewards to manage this HITL process.

*   **Dashboard Overview:**
    *   Summary statistics: Number of active GIGO rules, number of active Risk rules, number of new AI suggestions pending review.
    *   Performance indicators for existing rules (e.g., trigger frequency, correlation with positive/negative analytics, user feedback scores on rule helpfulness - V2+).

*   **AI Suggestions Queue:**
    *   A list of AI-generated suggestions for new or modified rules.
    *   Each item shows:
        *   Proposed rule type (GIGO/Risk), name/ID.
        *   Brief description of the AI's finding and suggestion.
        *   Key evidence/data points supporting the suggestion.
        *   AI confidence score (if applicable).
        *   Status (e.g., "Pending Review," "Under Test," "Approved," "Rejected").
    *   Actions per suggestion: "[View Details]", "[Approve for Testing]", "[Edit Suggestion]", "[Reject]".

*   **Rule Editor & Testing Interface:**
    *   When viewing/editing a suggestion or an existing rule:
        *   Fields to define/modify rule parameters (e.g., keywords, thresholds, `RiskLevel`, messages).
        *   An interface to run the rule against a test corpus of prompts and see its hypothetical triggers and false positive/negative rates.
    *   Version control or history for rule changes.

*   **Deployment Controls:**
    *   Mechanism to deploy approved rules to the production system (e.g., "[Activate Rule]", "[Deactivate Rule]").

This human-in-the-loop workflow, supported by a dedicated management UI, ensures that AI assistance enhances the rule systems responsibly and effectively, maintaining human control over the platform's guidance mechanisms.
