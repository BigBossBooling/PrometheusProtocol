# Prometheus Protocol: Error Handling & Recovery Strategies (Conceptual)

This document outlines conceptual strategies for handling errors and managing recovery scenarios during interactions between Prometheus Protocol and the hypothetical "Google Jules" AI engine. Robust error handling is crucial for system reliability, user trust, and a positive user experience.

## I. Introduction

Interactions with external AI services like "Jules" can encounter various issues, from network problems to API limits or content policy violations. Prometheus Protocol must be designed to anticipate these issues, handle them gracefully, provide clear feedback to the user, and recover where possible.

## II. Potential Error Categories from "Jules API" Interaction

Based on typical API interactions and our hypothetical "Jules API" contract (defined in `execution_logic.md`), we can anticipate the following categories of errors:

1.  **Network & Connectivity Errors:**
    *   **Description:** Issues preventing communication with the Jules API endpoint.
    *   **Examples:** DNS resolution failure, TCP connection timeout, Jules API server unreachable (e.g., HTTP 503 Service Unavailable from a load balancer or gateway before Jules itself).
    *   **Detection:** HTTP client exceptions (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `Timeout` from a `requests` library).

2.  **Authentication/Authorization Errors:**
    *   **Description:** Problems with the API key or user permissions.
    *   **Examples:** Invalid API key, expired API key, insufficient permissions for the requested operation.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) or HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status codes. Hypothetical Jules API error code like `AUTH_FAILURE`.

3.  **Invalid Request (Client-Side Errors):**
    *   **Description:** The request sent by `JulesExecutor` is malformed or doesn't adhere to the Jules API specification. While internal logic should aim to prevent this, it's a theoretical possibility.
    *   **Examples:** Missing required fields in the JSON payload, incorrect data types.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code. Jules might also return a specific error code detailing the validation issue.

4.  **Rate Limiting / Quota Exceeded Errors:**
    *   **Description:** The user or the system as a whole has made too many requests in a given time window, or exceeded a usage quota.
    *   **Examples:** Too many requests per second/minute/day.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status code. The API response might include a `Retry-After` header indicating when to try again.

5.  **Jules Internal Server Errors:**
    *   **Description:** An unexpected error occurred within the Jules AI engine itself while processing a valid request.
    *   **Examples:** Unhandled exceptions in Jules, temporary glitches.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code. Hypothetical Jules API error code like `JULES_ERR_SERVER_UNEXPECTED`.

6.  **Jules Content-Related Errors / Policy Violations:**
    *   **Description:** The user's prompt or the AI-generated response violates Jules's content policies or responsible AI guidelines.
    *   **Examples:** Request for harmful content, generation of inappropriate content.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400 (Bad Request) or another specific HTTP code. Hypothetical Jules API error code like `JULES_ERR_CONTENT_POLICY_VIOLATION`. The response might include details about the policy violated.

7.  **Jules Request Complexity / Model Limitations:**
    *   **Description:** The request is too complex for the current Jules model to handle effectively, or it hits resource limits (e.g., maximum prompt length, output token limits not caught by `max_tokens` setting if it's a different limit).
    *   **Examples:** Prompt too long, task too ambiguous leading to excessive processing.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400 (Bad Request) or HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity). Hypothetical Jules API error code like `JULES_ERR_REQUEST_TOO_COMPLEX` or `JULES_ERR_MAX_TOKENS_EXCEEDED_INTERNAL`.

8.  **Jules Model Overload / Temporary Capacity Issues:**
    *   **Description:** The specific Jules model or the service is temporarily overloaded or experiencing capacity issues.
    *   **Examples:** High traffic periods.
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) specifically from Jules (not just a gateway), or a specific Jules API error code like `JULES_ERR_MODEL_OVERLOADED`.

9.  **Unexpected Response Format / Deserialization Errors:**
    *   **Description:** Jules returns a valid HTTP success (e.g., 200 OK) but the JSON response body is malformed, missing expected fields, or has unexpected data types that `AIResponse.from_dict()` cannot handle.
    *   **Detection:** `json.JSONDecodeError` during response parsing, or `TypeError`/`KeyError`/`ValueError` during `AIResponse.from_dict()` processing.

## III. General Error Handling Principles

The following principles should guide the design of error handling and recovery mechanisms within Prometheus Protocol:

1.  **User-Centric Feedback:**
    *   **Clarity:** Error messages displayed to the user should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon wherever possible.
    *   **Actionability:** When feasible, error messages should suggest what the user might do next (e.g., "Please check your API key," "Try simplifying your request," "Please try again in a few moments.").
    *   **Contextual Relevance:** Errors should be presented in the context of the operation the user was attempting.

2.  **Comprehensive Logging:**
    *   **Server-Side/Backend Logging:** All errors, especially those from interactions with the Jules API or internal system failures, must be logged comprehensively on the server-side.
    *   **Log Details:** Logs should include timestamps, relevant IDs (user ID if applicable, `prompt_id`, `conversation_id`, `jules_request_id_client`, `jules_request_id_jules`), error codes, full error messages (including stack traces for system errors), and context about the operation being attempted.
    *   **Purpose:** Essential for diagnostics, monitoring system health, identifying patterns, and debugging.

3.  **Graceful Degradation & System Stability:**
    *   **No Catastrophic Failures:** Errors in one part of the system (e.g., a single Jules API call failing) should not cause the entire Prometheus Protocol application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Isolate Failures:** The impact of an error should be localized as much as possible. For instance, an error executing one turn in a conversation shouldn't necessarily prevent the user from interacting with other, already successfully executed turns or other parts of the application.

4.  **State Preservation:**
    *   **Protect User Work:** Errors occurring during an AI execution attempt (e.g., calling Jules) must not result in the loss of the user's crafted `PromptObject` or `Conversation` data that is currently being edited or composed in memory. The user should be able to retry or modify their input after an error without losing their work.
    *   **Consistent State:** The system should strive to maintain a consistent internal state even when errors occur.

5.  **Security and Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data:** User-facing error messages should not expose sensitive system information, internal stack traces, or overly detailed API responses that could be exploited.
    *   **Generic Messages for Security Risks:** For certain errors (e.g., some authentication failures), more generic messages might be preferable to avoid confirming specific system states to potential attackers.

6.  **Idempotency (for Retries):**
    *   Where retry mechanisms are implemented, the conceptual calls to Jules should ideally be idempotent if the operation itself is not naturally so. This means if Jules receives the same request multiple times due to retries, it should (ideally, if the API supports it via a unique request ID) produce the same result or not cause unintended side effects (like multiple identical resource creations). Our `request_id_client` in the hypothetical Jules API could facilitate this.

7.  **Configurability (for Retries and Timeouts):**
    *   (V2+ Consideration) Parameters for retry attempts, backoff strategies, and API timeouts might eventually be configurable at a system level.

These principles will help in designing specific error handling strategies that are robust, user-friendly, and maintain system integrity.

## IV. Strategies for Each Error Category

This section outlines specific conceptual strategies for handling the error categories identified in Section II, guided by the principles in Section III. These would primarily be implemented within the conceptual `JulesExecutor` or its calling orchestrator.

For each category, we consider:
*   **Detection:** How the error is identified.
*   **`AIResponse` Update:** How the `AIResponse` object is populated to reflect the error.
*   **Retry Strategy:** Whether and how retries should be attempted.
*   **User Notification (UI to derive from `AIResponse`):** The nature of the message conveyed to the user.
*   **Fallback/Recovery:** Any potential alternative actions.

---

**1. Network & Connectivity Errors**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP client exceptions (e.g., `ConnectionError`, `Timeout`).
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "Network error: Could not connect to the AI service. Please check your internet connection and try again."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` might store the exception details (for logging, not for UI).
    *   **Retry Strategy:** Yes. Implement exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries with delays like 1s, 3s, 5s). Include jitter to avoid thundering herd.
    *   **User Notification:** "A network connection error occurred. Retrying (attempt X of Y)..." If all retries fail: "Unable to connect to the AI service after multiple attempts. Please check your connection and try again later."
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** None beyond retries for V1.

---

**2. Authentication/Authorization Errors**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 401/403. Hypothetical Jules API code `AUTH_FAILURE`.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "Authentication failed. Please check your API key or credentials for the AI service."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores the API error details.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** No. Retrying with the same credentials will likely fail again.
    *   **User Notification:** "Authentication Error: Invalid or missing API key for the AI service. Please verify your settings." (UI might link to a settings page).
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** User needs to correct their API key/credentials.

---

**3. Invalid Request (Client-Side Errors)**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400. Specific Jules API error if it validates request structure.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "Invalid request sent to the AI service. This usually indicates an internal issue with the application. Please report this error."` (User-facing message should be careful not to blame user if it's truly an internal `JulesExecutor` bug).
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores detailed API error.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** No. The request needs to be fixed.
    *   **User Notification:** "Invalid Request: The application sent an invalid request to the AI service. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact support." (Log details extensively for developers).
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** Requires developer intervention if it's a bug in request formation.

---

**4. Rate Limiting / Quota Exceeded Errors**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 429. API response might include `Retry-After` header.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "AI service rate limit or quota exceeded. Please try again later."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores API error.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** Yes, if `Retry-After` header is present, honor it. Otherwise, use exponential backoff (e.g., 2-3 retries with longer initial delays like 5s, 15s, 30s).
    *   **User Notification:** "You've reached the usage limit for the AI service. Please try again in [Retry-After duration] / a few moments." If retries fail: "Rate limit still active. Please wait longer before retrying."
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** User must wait. (V2+ could involve UI showing current quota usage if API provides it).

---

**5. Jules Internal Server Errors**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 500. Hypothetical Jules API code `JULES_ERR_SERVER_UNEXPECTED`.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "The AI service encountered an internal error. Please try again in a few moments."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores API error.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** Yes. Exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries with 2s, 5s, 10s). These are often transient.
    *   **User Notification:** "AI Service Error: An unexpected error occurred on the AI service's side. Retrying (attempt X of Y)..." If retries fail: "The AI service is still experiencing issues. Please try again later."
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** None beyond retries for V1.

---

**6. Jules Content-Related Errors / Policy Violations**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400 or specific Jules code (e.g., `JULES_ERR_CONTENT_POLICY_VIOLATION`).
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "The request or generated content was flagged due to content policies. Please review your prompt and try to rephrase, ensuring it aligns with responsible AI guidelines."` (Message might be more specific if Jules API provides details, e.g., "Blocked due to safety policy X.")
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores API error and policy details.
        *   `content = None` (or a placeholder like "[Content Blocked Due to Policy Violation]").
    *   **Retry Strategy:** No. The prompt content needs modification.
    *   **User Notification:** Display the specific error message from `AIResponse`. UI should clearly indicate that the prompt content needs to be revised.
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** User must revise their prompt. No automated recovery.

---

**7. Jules Request Complexity / Model Limitations**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 400/422. Jules codes like `JULES_ERR_REQUEST_TOO_COMPLEX`, `JULES_ERR_MAX_TOKENS_EXCEEDED_INTERNAL`.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "The request was too complex for the AI model to handle (e.g., prompt too long, or task too ambiguous for current settings). Please try simplifying your prompt, reducing its length, or adjusting constraints."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores API error.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** No. The prompt needs modification.
    *   **User Notification:** Display specific error message. Guide user to simplify, shorten, or add clarity/constraints.
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** User must revise their prompt.

---

**8. Jules Model Overload / Temporary Capacity Issues**
    *   **Detection:** HTTP 503 (from Jules, not gateway). Jules code like `JULES_ERR_MODEL_OVERLOADED`.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "The AI model is temporarily overloaded or experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few moments."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores API error.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** Yes. Exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries with 5s, 15s, 30s).
    *   **User Notification:** "AI Model Overloaded: The AI model is currently busy. Retrying (attempt X of Y)..." If retries fail: "The AI model is still overloaded. Please try again later."
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** (V2+) Could offer to switch to a different (less capable but available) model if Prometheus Protocol supported multiple model backends. For V1, user must wait.

---

**9. Unexpected Response Format / Deserialization Errors**
    *   **Detection:** `json.JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError`/`KeyError`/`ValueError` during `AIResponse.from_dict()`.
    *   **`AIResponse` Update:**
        *   `was_successful = False`
        *   `error_message = "Received an unexpected or malformed response from the AI service. This may be a temporary issue or an API change. Please try again. If it persists, contact support."`
        *   `raw_jules_response` stores the problematic raw response string/dict.
    *   **Retry Strategy:** Maybe 1-2 retries with short delay, as it could be a transient network corruption. If it persists, it's likely a more systematic issue.
    *   **User Notification:** "Unexpected Response: Received an unreadable response from the AI service. Please try again. If this continues, please report the issue." (Log extensively for developers).
    *   **Fallback/Recovery:** Requires developer investigation if it's a persistent API contract change or bug in parsing.
