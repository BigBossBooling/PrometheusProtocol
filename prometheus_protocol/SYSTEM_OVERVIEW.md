## 2. Guiding Principles (The Expanded KISS Principle)

The design and conceptualization of Prometheus Protocol are guided by Josephis K. Wade's "Expanded KISS Principle." This section briefly outlines each principle and highlights its application within the project.

*   **K - Know Your Core, Keep it Clear (Clarity & Accessibility): The GIGO Antidote.**
    *   **Principle:** Emphasizes precision, clarity in purpose, and eliminating ambiguity, especially at the input stage, to ensure high-quality output.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The detailed structure of the `PromptObject` dataclass, with distinct fields for `role`, `context`, `task`, `constraints`, and `examples`, forces clarity in prompt definition.
        *   The `GIGO Guardrail` (`validate_prompt` function) directly embodies this by enforcing basic structural and content rules (e.g., non-empty fields, correct list item types, no unresolved placeholders), preventing "Garbage In."
        *   The UI concepts for the `PromptObject Editor` focus on providing clear input fields and direct feedback for these core components.

*   **I - Iterate Intelligently, Integrate Intuitively (Efficiency & Engagement): The Law of Constant Progression.**
    *   **Principle:** Focuses on continuous improvement, learning from interactions, and making systems efficient and engaging to use.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The `TemplateManager` and `ConversationManager` with versioning support allow users to save, load, and iterate on their prompts and conversations, tracking their evolution.
        *   The conceptual "Output Analytics" feature is designed to provide feedback on prompt performance, enabling users to intelligently refine their strategies.
        *   The "Creative Catalyst Modules" are conceptualized to make the prompt creation process more engaging and to help users iterate on ideas more effectively.

*   **S - Systematize for Scalability, Synchronize for Synergy (Structure & Consistency): The Brand Blueprint.**
    *   **Principle:** Stresses the importance of structured approaches, consistent design, and creating systems that can scale and where components work harmoniously together.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The use of distinct managers (`TemplateManager`, `ConversationManager`) provides a systematic way to handle different types of core assets.
        *   The definition of shared data structures like `PromptObject` and `AIResponse` ensures consistency in how data is handled across different conceptual components (e.g., editor, executor, analytics).
        *   The V1 "Collaboration Features" concepts, with shared workspaces and roles, aim to systematize team-based prompt engineering.

*   **S - Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution (Strategic & Polished): The Marketing Protocol.**
    *   **Principle:** Involves understanding the broader context, anticipating potential issues (like misuse or ethical concerns), and building in safeguards or guidance to ensure robust and responsible solutions.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The `RiskIdentifier` component directly addresses this by analyzing prompts for potential issues beyond basic syntax, guiding users towards safer and more effective prompting.
        *   The conceptual "Authenticity Check" features aim to help users consider the provenance and transparency of AI-generated content.
        *   The "Error Handling & Recovery Strategies" conceptualization is about building a resilient system that can handle unexpected issues from the AI service.

*   **S - Stimulate Engagement, Sustain Impact (Humanity & Voice): The Authentic Connection.**
    *   **Principle:** Focuses on the human element, making technology not just functional but also engaging, empowering, and capable of producing outputs that resonate authentically.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The "Creative Catalyst Modules" are designed to make prompt creation more stimulating and less of a chore, helping users find their "voice" in crafting prompts.
        *   The UI concepts for displaying AI responses (e.g., rendering formatted content, clear conversation transcripts) aim to make the interaction with AI outputs more engaging and understandable.
        *   The overall vision of Prometheus Protocol as a tool to elevate human intent in AI collaboration speaks to creating a more impactful and authentic connection with AI capabilities.

## 4. Core Logic Components/Managers

This section describes the main classes, functions, and conceptual components that encapsulate the core business logic and operational capabilities of Prometheus Protocol.

*   **GIGO Guardrail (`validate_prompt` function)** ([`core/guardrails.py`](./core/guardrails.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Validates `PromptObject` instances against a set of structural and content quality rules (both basic and advanced). Ensures prompts are well-formed before further processing or saving.
    *   **Key Function:** `validate_prompt(prompt: PromptObject) -> None`
    *   **Core Functionality:** Checks for empty required fields, correct list item types, unresolved placeholders, repetitive list items, etc. Raises specific custom exceptions (from `core.exceptions`) on validation failure.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`.
    *   **Produces:** Raises exceptions (various `PromptValidationError` subtypes).

*   **`RiskIdentifier`** ([`core/risk_identifier.py`](./core/risk_identifier.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Analyzes `PromptObject` instances for potential semantic, ethical, or effectiveness risks that go beyond basic syntax checks. Aims to guide users towards safer and more effective prompt engineering.
    *   **Key Method:** `identify_risks(prompt: PromptObject) -> List[PotentialRisk]`
    *   **Core Functionality:** Implements rules to detect issues like lack of specificity, presence of sensitive keywords without appropriate caution, or unconstrained complex tasks.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`.
    *   **Produces:** `List[PotentialRisk]`.

*   **`TemplateManager`** ([`core/template_manager.py`](./core/template_manager.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the persistence (saving, loading, listing) of `PromptObject` instances as versioned templates on the file system.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   `save_template(prompt: PromptObject, template_name: str) -> PromptObject`: Saves a prompt, assigning/incrementing its version.
        *   `load_template(template_name: str, version: Optional[int] = None) -> PromptObject`: Loads the latest or a specific version of a prompt template.
        *   `list_templates() -> Dict[str, List[int]]`: Lists all template base names and their available versions.
    *   **Core Functionality:** Handles filename sanitization, version number management, JSON serialization/deserialization of `PromptObject`s.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`, file system (within its configured `templates_dir_path`).
    *   **Produces/Consumes:** `PromptObject` instances, JSON files.

*   **`ConversationManager`** ([`core/conversation_manager.py`](./core/conversation_manager.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the persistence (saving, loading, listing) of `Conversation` objects on the file system. `Conversation` objects are not explicitly versioned by this manager in V1; saving with an existing name overwrites.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   `save_conversation(conversation: Conversation, conversation_name: str) -> Conversation`: Saves a conversation, updates its `last_modified_at` timestamp, and returns the updated `Conversation` object.
        *   `load_conversation(conversation_name: str) -> Conversation`.
        *   `list_conversations() -> List[str]`: Returns a list of base conversation names. Unlike `TemplateManager`, `Conversation` objects are not explicitly versioned by `ConversationManager` in the current design; saving with an existing name overwrites the file.
    *   **Core Functionality:** Handles filename sanitization, JSON serialization/deserialization of `Conversation` objects (which include `PromptTurn` and nested `PromptObject`s).
    *   **Operates On:** `Conversation`, file system (within its configured `conversations_dir_path`).
    *   **Produces/Consumes:** `Conversation` instances, JSON files.

*   **`JulesExecutor` (Conceptual Stub)** ([`core/jules_executor.py`](./core/jules_executor.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** (Conceptually) Manages all direct interaction with the hypothetical "Google Jules" AI engine. This includes formatting requests, "making API calls," and parsing responses.
    *   **Key Methods (Conceptual Stubs):**
        *   `_prepare_jules_request_payload(prompt: PromptObject, history: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]]) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Formats data for the Jules API, merging default execution settings with any settings provided in `PromptObject.settings`.
        *   `execute_prompt(prompt: PromptObject) -> AIResponse`: "Executes" a single prompt.
        *   `execute_conversation_turn(turn: PromptTurn, current_conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> AIResponse`: "Executes" a single turn of a conversation.
    *   **Core Functionality (Simulated):** Prepares request dictionaries based on `PromptObject` and history. Returns dynamic, simulated `AIResponse` objects that can mimic successful outputs or various error conditions based on input characteristics.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`, `PromptTurn`, `List[Dict[str,str]]` (for history).
    *   **Produces:** `AIResponse` (simulated).

## 7. Identified Areas for Future Refinement/Development

This section serves as a "refinement backlog," capturing potential areas for improvement, further development, or aspects that require more detailed conceptualization or implementation based on the review of the current system design.

### A. Core Logic & Data Structures

1.  **`ConversationManager` Return Types & Versioning Scope:**
    *   **Status: Partially DONE (for `save_conversation` return type); Versioning for `Conversation` objects Deferred (as of current iteration)**
    *   **Summary of Changes Made:**
        *   The `save_conversation` method in [`core/conversation_manager.py`](./core/conversation_manager.py) now correctly returns the updated `Conversation` object (after its `last_modified_at` timestamp is modified by `touch()`). This aligns its behavior more closely with `TemplateManager.save_template`.
    *   **Decision on Versioning for Conversations (Current Scope):**
        *   `Conversation` objects do **not** currently have a `version` attribute.
        *   `ConversationManager` does **not** implement explicit versioning logic (e.g., creating `_vX.json` files). Saving a conversation with an existing name will overwrite the existing file.
        *   Consequently, `ConversationManager.list_conversations()` correctly continues to return `List[str]` (a list of unique base conversation names).
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):**
        *   If explicit versioning for `Conversation` objects becomes a requirement, this would involve:
            1.  Adding a `version: int` field to the `Conversation` dataclass.
            2.  Updating `ConversationManager` to fully mirror `TemplateManager`'s versioning logic (handling `_vX.json` filenames, `_get_highest_version`, etc.).
            3.  Changing `list_conversations()` to return `Dict[str, List[int]]`.
        *   This is considered a separate, larger future enhancement if needed.

2.  **`PromptObject` - `created_by_user_id` Field Added:**
    *   **Status: DONE**
    *   **Summary:** Added `created_by_user_id: Optional[str] = None` to `PromptObject` ([`core/prompt.py`](./core/prompt.py)). This field allows for tracking the original creator of a prompt, which is beneficial for attribution, especially in collaborative workspace contexts.
    *   **Serialization:** Handled in `to_dict()` and `from_dict()`. Defaults to `None` if missing in deserialized data.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** Integration with a user authentication system to automatically populate this field upon `PromptObject` creation by a logged-in user. UI concepts to display this information where relevant.

3.  **`AIResponse` - Storing `source_conversation_id`:**
    *   **Issue:** The `JulesExecutor.execute_conversation_turn` currently notes that `source_conversation_id` in the `AIResponse` would be set by the calling orchestrator.
    *   **Refinement:** Ensure that any conceptual `run_conversation_flow` orchestrator (as described in `execution_logic.md`) is explicitly responsible for populating this field in the `AIResponse` objects it receives for each turn.
    *   **Action:** Confirm this detail in `execution_logic.md` or related orchestrator concepts if they are further detailed.

4.  **`PromptObject.settings` Field and `JulesExecutor` Integration for Dynamic Settings:**
    *   **Status: DONE**
    *   **Summary:** Added `settings: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` to `PromptObject` ([`core/prompt.py`](./core/prompt.py)). The `JulesExecutor._prepare_jules_request_payload` method in ([`core/jules_executor.py`](./core/jules_executor.py)) was updated to merge these prompt-specific settings with its own defaults, allowing `PromptObject` instances to carry their preferred execution parameters (e.g., temperature, max_tokens).
    *   **Serialization:** Handled in `PromptObject.to_dict()` and `from_dict()`.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** UI concepts for an "Execution Settings Panel" in the `PromptObject` editor have been added to `prompt_editor.md`. Further UI implementation would be needed.

### B. Conceptual Features & UI

1.  **`Collaboration Features` - Granular Permissions & Audit Trails (V2):**
    *   **Issue:** V1 collaboration relies on workspace-level roles and has no detailed audit trails.
    *   **Refinement:** Future versions (V2+) should explore per-item permissions within a workspace and comprehensive audit logging for changes to shared resources.
    *   **Action:** Keep as V2+ scope in `collaboration_features.md`.

2.  **`Collaboration Features` - Merging Divergent Versions (V2):**
    *   **Issue:** V1 handles concurrent edits by creating divergent versions (implicit branches).
    *   **Refinement:** V2+ could explore UI and logic for comparing and merging different versions of a template/conversation.
    *   **Action:** Keep as V2+ scope in `collaboration_features.md`.

3.  **`Creative Catalyst Modules` - AI Implementation Details:**
    *   **Issue:** These are currently conceptual regarding *what* they do for the user. The *how* (e.g., would they themselves call Jules or use other NLP techniques?) is undefined.
    *   **Refinement:** Future work would need to detail the implementation strategy for each catalyst module.
    *   **Action:** Note as future implementation detail.

4.  **`Output Analytics` - Feedback Collection UI Details:**
    *   **Issue:** The UI for *collecting* analytics feedback is only briefly mentioned.
    *   **Refinement:** A more detailed UI concept for the feedback form (ratings, tags, notes) that appears after AI response generation would be needed.
    *   **Action:** Add to potential future UI refinement tasks.

5.  **User Settings/Preferences Data Model:**
    *   **Status: DONE**
    *   **Summary:** Defined `UserSettings` dataclass in [`core/user_settings.py`](./core/user_settings.py) to structure user-specific configurations like default API keys, preferred Jules model, default `PromptObject` execution settings, UI theme, language preferences, and creative catalyst defaults. Includes serialization methods.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** Conceptualize and implement a `UserSettingsManager` for persistence; integrate into UI for user modification; fully integrate into `JulesExecutor` and other components to use these settings.

### C. Terminology & Consistency

1.  **"Template Name" vs. "Base Name":**
    *   **Issue:** `TemplateManager` methods sometimes refer to `template_name` which becomes a `base_name` after sanitization and before versioning.
    *   **Refinement:** Ensure method parameters and internal variable names are consistently clear about whether they refer to the user-facing name or the sanitized base name.
    *   **Action:** Review `TemplateManager` code and docstrings for consistent terminology. (This can be a minor code-level refinement).
