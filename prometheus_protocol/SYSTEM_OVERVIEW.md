## 2. Guiding Principles (The Expanded KISS Principle)

The design and conceptualization of Prometheus Protocol are guided by Josephis K. Wade's "Expanded KISS Principle." This section briefly outlines each principle and highlights its application within the project.

*   **K - Know Your Core, Keep it Clear (Clarity & Accessibility): The GIGO Antidote.**
    *   **Principle:** Emphasizes precision, clarity in purpose, and eliminating ambiguity, especially at the input stage, to ensure high-quality output.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The detailed structure of the `PromptObject` dataclass, with distinct fields for `role`, `context`, `task`, `constraints`, and `examples`, forces clarity in prompt definition.
        *   The `GIGO Guardrail` (`validate_prompt` function) directly embodies this by enforcing basic structural and content rules (e.g., non-empty fields, correct list item types, no unresolved placeholders), preventing "Garbage In."
        *   The UI concepts for the `PromptObject Editor` focus on providing clear input fields and direct feedback for these core components.

*   **I - Iterate Intelligently, Integrate Intuitively (Efficiency & Engagement): The Law of Constant Progression.**
    *   **Principle:** Focuses on continuous improvement, learning from interactions, and making systems efficient and engaging to use.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The `TemplateManager` and `ConversationManager` with versioning support allow users to save, load, and iterate on their prompts and conversations, tracking their evolution.
        *   The conceptual "Output Analytics" feature is designed to provide feedback on prompt performance, enabling users to intelligently refine their strategies.
        *   The "Creative Catalyst Modules" are conceptualized to make the prompt creation process more engaging and to help users iterate on ideas more effectively.

*   **S - Systematize for Scalability, Synchronize for Synergy (Structure & Consistency): The Brand Blueprint.**
    *   **Principle:** Stresses the importance of structured approaches, consistent design, and creating systems that can scale and where components work harmoniously together.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The use of distinct managers (`TemplateManager`, `ConversationManager`) provides a systematic way to handle different types of core assets.
        *   The definition of shared data structures like `PromptObject` and `AIResponse` ensures consistency in how data is handled across different conceptual components (e.g., editor, executor, analytics).
        *   The V1 "Collaboration Features" concepts, with shared workspaces and roles, aim to systematize team-based prompt engineering.

*   **S - Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution (Strategic & Polished): The Marketing Protocol.**
    *   **Principle:** Involves understanding the broader context, anticipating potential issues (like misuse or ethical concerns), and building in safeguards or guidance to ensure robust and responsible solutions.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The `RiskIdentifier` component directly addresses this by analyzing prompts for potential issues beyond basic syntax, guiding users towards safer and more effective prompting.
        *   The conceptual "Authenticity Check" features aim to help users consider the provenance and transparency of AI-generated content.
        *   The "Error Handling & Recovery Strategies" conceptualization is about building a resilient system that can handle unexpected issues from the AI service.

*   **S - Stimulate Engagement, Sustain Impact (Humanity & Voice): The Authentic Connection.**
    *   **Principle:** Focuses on the human element, making technology not just functional but also engaging, empowering, and capable of producing outputs that resonate authentically.
    *   **Application Examples:**
        *   The "Creative Catalyst Modules" are designed to make prompt creation more stimulating and less of a chore, helping users find their "voice" in crafting prompts.
        *   The UI concepts for displaying AI responses (e.g., rendering formatted content, clear conversation transcripts) aim to make the interaction with AI outputs more engaging and understandable.
        *   The overall vision of Prometheus Protocol as a tool to elevate human intent in AI collaboration speaks to creating a more impactful and authentic connection with AI capabilities.

    *   **Key Method:** `identify_risks(prompt: PromptObject) -> List[PotentialRisk]`
    *   **Core Functionality:** Implements rules to detect issues like lack of specificity, presence of sensitive keywords without appropriate caution, or unconstrained complex tasks.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`.
    *   **Produces:** `List[PotentialRisk]`.

*   **`TemplateManager`** ([`core/template_manager.py`](./core/template_manager.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the persistence (saving, loading, listing) of `PromptObject` instances as versioned templates on the file system.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   `save_template(prompt: PromptObject, template_name: str) -> PromptObject`: Saves a prompt, assigning/incrementing its version.
        *   `load_template(template_name: str, version: Optional[int] = None) -> PromptObject`: Loads the latest or a specific version of a prompt template.
        *   `list_templates() -> Dict[str, List[int]]`: Lists all template base names and their available versions.
        *   `delete_template_version(template_name: str, version: int) -> bool`: Deletes a specific version of a template. Returns `True` on success.

    *   **Core Functionality:** Handles filename sanitization, version number management, JSON serialization/deserialization, and deletion of `PromptObject` template files.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`, file system (within its configured `templates_dir_path`).
    *   **Produces/Consumes:** `PromptObject` instances, JSON files.

*   **`ConversationManager`** ([`core/conversation_manager.py`](./core/conversation_manager.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the persistence (saving, loading, listing) of `Conversation` objects as versioned files on the file system.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   `save_conversation(conversation: Conversation, conversation_name: str) -> Conversation`: Saves a conversation, assigning/incrementing its version number and updating `last_modified_at`. Returns the updated `Conversation`.
        *   `load_conversation(conversation_name: str, version: Optional[int] = None) -> Conversation`: Loads the latest or a specific version of a conversation.

*   **`JulesExecutor` (Conceptual Stub)** ([`core/jules_executor.py`](./core/jules_executor.py))
    *   **Responsibility:** (Conceptually) Manages all direct interaction with the hypothetical "Google Jules" AI engine. This includes formatting requests, "making API calls," and parsing responses.
    *   **Key Methods (Conceptual Stubs):**
        *   `_prepare_jules_request_payload(prompt: PromptObject, user_settings: Optional[UserSettings] = None, history: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Formats data for the Jules API.
        *   `execute_prompt(prompt: PromptObject, user_settings: Optional[UserSettings] = None) -> AIResponse`: "Executes" a single prompt.
        *   `execute_conversation_turn(turn: PromptTurn, current_conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]], user_settings: Optional[UserSettings] = None) -> AIResponse`: "Executes" a single turn of a conversation.
    *   **Core Functionality (Simulated):** Prepares request dictionaries. It establishes a settings hierarchy for execution parameters: `PromptObject.settings` override `UserSettings.default_execution_settings`, which in turn override hardcoded executor defaults. It also uses `UserSettings.default_jules_api_key` (if executor's initial key is a placeholder) and `UserSettings.preferred_output_language`. Returns dynamic, simulated `AIResponse` objects.
    *   **Operates On:** `PromptObject`, `UserSettings`, `PromptTurn`, `List[Dict[str,str]]` (for history).

    *   **Key Method:** `run_full_conversation(conversation: Conversation) -> Dict[str, AIResponse]`
    *   **Core Functionality:** Iterates through `PromptTurn`s in a `Conversation`. Passes the stored `UserSettings` object to `JulesExecutor` when executing each turn. Manages the `conversation_history` list passed between turns, populates `AIResponse.source_conversation_id`, and collects all `AIResponse` objects. For V1, halts execution on the first turn that results in an error.
    *   **Operates On:** `Conversation`, `JulesExecutor`, `UserSettings`.
    *   **Produces:** `Dict[str, AIResponse]` (mapping turn IDs to their responses).

    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the persistence (saving and loading) of `UserSettings` objects to the file system. Each user's settings are stored in a dedicated JSON file.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   `save_settings(settings: UserSettings) -> UserSettings`: Saves a user's settings, updates `last_updated_at`, and returns the updated object.
        *   `load_settings(user_id: str) -> Optional[UserSettings]`: Loads a user's settings; returns `None` if not found.
    *   **Core Functionality:** Handles user-specific file path generation, JSON serialization/deserialization of `UserSettings` objects, and error handling for corrupted settings files (raises `UserSettingsCorruptedError`).
    *   **Operates On:** `UserSettings`, file system (within its configured `settings_base_dir_path`).
    *   **Produces/Consumes:** `UserSettings` instances, JSON files.

## 7. Identified Areas for Future Refinement/Development

This section serves as a "refinement backlog," capturing potential areas for improvement, further development, or aspects that require more detailed conceptualization or implementation based on the review of the current system design.

### A. Core Logic & Data Structures

1.  **`ConversationManager` - Full Versioning Implemented:**
    *   **Status: DONE (as of a recent iteration)**
    *   **Summary:** The `Conversation` dataclass in [`core/conversation.py`](./core/conversation.py) now includes a `version: int = 1` attribute. `ConversationManager` in [`core/conversation_manager.py`](./core/conversation_manager.py) has been fully refactored to implement versioning for conversations, mirroring `TemplateManager`. This includes: `save_conversation` assigns/increments `conversation.version` and `last_modified_at`, saves to versioned filenames (e.g., `name_v1.json`), and returns the updated `Conversation`; `load_conversation` handles latest or specific versions; `list_conversations` returns `Dict[str, List[int]]`. This completes the planned versioning refinements for `ConversationManager`.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** UI concepts in `conversation_composer.md` have been updated to reflect interaction with versioned conversations. Further UI implementation would be needed to fully surface these capabilities.

2.  **`PromptObject` - `created_by_user_id` Field Added:**
    *   **Status: DONE (as of a recent iteration)**
    *   **Summary:** Added `created_by_user_id: Optional[str] = None` to `PromptObject` ([`core/prompt.py`](./core/prompt.py)) for attribution. Serialization handled. Populating with actual user IDs is future work tied to user authentication.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** Integration with a user authentication system to automatically populate this field. UI concepts to display this information where relevant.

3.  **`AIResponse` - Populating `source_conversation_id`:**
    *   **Status: DONE (as of a recent iteration - Implemented in `ConversationOrchestrator`)**
    *   **Summary:** `ConversationOrchestrator.run_full_conversation` in [`core/conversation_orchestrator.py`](./core/conversation_orchestrator.py) now populates `source_conversation_id` in each `AIResponse` during conversation execution.

4.  **`PromptObject.settings` Field and `JulesExecutor` Integration for Dynamic Settings:**
    *   **Status: DONE (as of a recent iteration)**
    *   **Summary:** Added `settings: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` to `PromptObject` ([`core/prompt.py`](./core/prompt.py)). `JulesExecutor` merges these with defaults. Serialization handled.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):** UI concepts for an "Execution Settings Panel" in the `PromptObject` editor have been added to `prompt_editor.md`. Further UI implementation would be needed.

5.  **User Settings/Preferences Data Model & Basic Persistence:**
    *   **Status: DONE (as of current iteration)**
    *   **Summary:** Defined `UserSettings` dataclass in [`core/user_settings.py`](./core/user_settings.py) for user-specific configurations. Implemented `UserSettingsManager` in [`core/user_settings_manager.py`](./core/user_settings_manager.py) for file-based persistence. `JulesExecutor` and `ConversationOrchestrator` were updated to accept and utilize `UserSettings` to establish a settings hierarchy (Prompt > User > Executor defaults) for API key, execution parameters, and user preferences like language. A basic "User Settings" page was added to `streamlit_app.py` for viewing, editing, and saving these settings.
    *   **Next Steps (Future Work):**
            *   More granular UI for editing complex settings (e.g., `default_execution_settings`, `creative_catalyst_defaults`) beyond raw JSON.
            *   Full UI integration for all `UserSettings` fields (e.g., UI theme application, Creative Catalyst modules actually using their defaults from `UserSettings`).
            *   Secure storage and handling mechanisms for sensitive settings like API keys, especially in a production or multi-user cloud environment (currently stored in local JSON).
            *   Integration with a full User Account Management system (registration, login, profiles) if Prometheus Protocol evolves into a multi-user application beyond the current single "default_streamlit_user".

6.  **`GIGO Guardrail (`validate_prompt`)` - Return All Errors for Granular UI Feedback:**
    *   **Status:** **DONE (as of current iteration)**
    *   **Summary:** The `core.guardrails.validate_prompt` function in [`core/guardrails.py`](./core/guardrails.py) has been refactored to return a `List[PromptValidationError]` instead of raising an exception on the first error. This allows for the collection and display of all GIGO validation issues for a `PromptObject` simultaneously. The `display_gigo_feedback` helper function in the `streamlit_app.py` prototype has been updated to iterate through this list and display all reported errors to the user, enhancing the comprehensiveness of validation feedback.

### B. Conceptual Features & UI

1.  **`Collaboration Features` - Granular Permissions & Audit Trails (V2):**
    *   **Status: V2+ Feature / Future Conceptualization**
    *   **Summary:** V1 collaboration concepts focus on workspace-level roles. Future versions should explore per-item permissions within workspaces and implement comprehensive audit trails for changes to shared resources.

2.  **`Collaboration Features` - Merging Divergent Versions (V2):**
    *   **Status: V2+ Feature / Future Conceptualization**
    *   **Summary:** V1 handles concurrent edits by creating divergent versions (implicit branching). Future versions could introduce UI and logic for comparing and merging these different versions of templates or conversations.

3.  **`Creative Catalyst Modules` - AI Implementation Details:**
    *   **Status: Implementation Detail for Future Development**
    *   **Summary:** The purpose, conceptual UI integration, and user controls (like 'Creativity Level') for several Creative Catalyst Modules have been defined in [`concepts/creative_catalyst_modules.md`](./concepts/creative_catalyst_modules.md). The specific AI/NLP techniques or models to power their suggestion generation are future implementation details.

4.  **`Output Analytics` - Feedback Collection UI Details:**
    *   **Status: Further UI Conceptualization Needed**
    *   **Summary:** The `AnalyticsEntry` data model and high-level UI concepts for *displaying* analytics are defined in [`concepts/output_analytics.md`](./concepts/output_analytics.md). Detailed UI mockups or paper prototypes for the *feedback collection forms* (that appear after AI response generation) require further design.

5.  **User Account Management & Global Settings (V2+):**
    *   **Status: V2+ Major Feature Area / Future Conceptualization**
    *   **Summary:** While the `UserSettings` dataclass and `UserSettingsManager` provide basic persistence for user preferences, a full User Account Management system (registration, login, profiles) and a comprehensive UI for managing all global user settings (including secure API key management beyond local files) are significant V2+ undertakings.

### C. Terminology & Consistency

1.  **"Template Name" vs. "Base Name":**
    *   **Status: Acknowledged; For Future Code-Level Review.**
    *   **Summary:** The distinction between user-facing 'template/conversation name' (which can contain spaces and special characters) and the internal 'base_name' (sanitized for use in filenames before versioning suffixes are added) is noted. Current usage within `TemplateManager` and `ConversationManager` and their helpers (`_sanitize_base_name`, `_construct_filename`) is functional. Terminology in code comments, internal documentation, and potentially user-facing error messages related to filenames could be reviewed for strict consistency during any future direct refactoring of these manager modules.

**Overall Status of V1 Conceptual Refinements:** All critical V1 refinements identified for core data structures and manager functionalities in subsection 7.A have now been completed and documented as "DONE." Items in 7.B (Conceptual Features & UI) correctly reflect their status as being primarily for future V2+ development or deeper conceptualization. The item in 7.C (Terminology & Consistency) is acknowledged for ongoing code-level attention during future refactoring. The V1 conceptual backend architecture and its core components are now considered stable, well-documented, and internally consistent based on the completion of this review cycle.
