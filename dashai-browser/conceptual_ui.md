# Conceptual UI/UX Elements in DashAIBrowser

This document describes the conceptual UI/UX elements for integrating Prometheus Protocol with DashAIBrowser.

## AI-Assisted Content Creation Toolbar/Sidebar

A new toolbar or sidebar will be added to the DashAIBrowser UI. This toolbar will be available in any text field, such as a text editor or a social media post composer.

The toolbar will contain a button labeled "Generate with AI." When the user clicks this button, a dialog will appear where they can select a prompt template and provide values for any dynamic variables.

The dialog will also provide a "Generate" button. When the user clicks this button, the `GenerateOptimizedPrompt` RPC will be called to generate the prompt. The generated prompt will then be inserted into the text field.

## DevTools Prompt Engineering Panel

A new panel will be added to the DashAIBrowser DevTools. This panel will be called "Prompt Engineering."

The Prompt Engineering panel will allow developers to:

*   Create, edit, and delete prompt templates.
*   Test prompt templates by providing values for dynamic variables and seeing the generated prompt.
*   View the history of generated prompts and their feedback.
*   Submit feedback on LLM responses.

## Feedback Mechanism

A discreet "thumbs up/down" or "Rate AI Response" icon will be displayed next to any AI-generated content. When the user clicks this icon, a dialog will appear where they can provide a rating and written feedback.

When the user submits the feedback, the `SubmitPromptFeedback` RPC will be called to send the feedback to the Prometheus Protocol backend.
