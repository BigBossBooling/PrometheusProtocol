# Conceptual UI Elements for Quantum-Accelerated Computation

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the Quantum-Accelerated Computation feature in DashAIBrowser.

## Context Menu Option

When a user selects a complex data set or a mathematical expression on a web page, a new option will appear in the context menu: "Quantum Accelerate Selection."

When the user clicks this option, the selected data will be sent to the AI-vCPU for processing. The results will be displayed in a pop-up window.

## DevTools Panel

A new tab will be added to the DevTools called "Quantum Compute." This panel will allow developers to:

*   Submit conceptual quantum tasks to the AI-vCPU.
*   Run simulations of quantum algorithms.
*   View the results of quantum computations.
*   Debug quantum programs.

## "Quantum Boost" Indicator

A subtle visual cue will be displayed in the browser UI to indicate when quantum computation is active. This cue could be a glowing icon, a pulsating animation, or a change in the color of the toolbar.

The purpose of this indicator is to provide feedback to the user that a quantum-accelerated task is in progress.

## Visual Feedback for Quantum Processing

When a quantum computation is in progress, the browser will display a visual representation of the quantum state. This will allow users to see how the quantum computation is evolving over time.

The visual representation could be a 3D animation of a qubit, a graph of the quantum state, or a table of the quantum amplitudes.
