# Conceptual UI Elements for Neuromorphic Efficiency Modes

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the Neuromorphic Efficiency Modes feature in DashAIBrowser.

## "Green Mode" / "Eco AI" Indicator

A subtle icon, such as a leaf or a battery, will be displayed in the toolbar or status bar. This icon will change color or animation to indicate the current efficiency mode. For example:

*   **Green:** The browser is in "Green Mode," and all non-essential AI features are running in a low-power state.
*   **Yellow:** The browser is in a balanced mode, with some AI features running in a low-power state.
*   **Red:** The browser is in a high-performance mode, and all AI features are running at full power.

The user will be able to hover over the icon to see a tooltip with more information about the current efficiency mode.

## Settings Panel

A new section will be added to the browser settings called "Neuromorphic Efficiency." This section will allow the user to configure when the different efficiency modes are activated.

The user will be able to choose from a number of presets, such as:

*   **Automatic:** The browser will automatically switch between efficiency modes based on the user's current activity and power source.
*   **On Battery:** The browser will automatically switch to "Green Mode" when the device is running on battery power.
*   **When Idle:** The browser will automatically switch to "Green Mode" when the user is idle for a certain period of time.
*   **Always On:** The browser will always run in "Green Mode."

The user will also be able to create their own custom presets.

## Notifications

When the browser switches between efficiency modes, a notification will be displayed to the user. The notification will inform the user of the new efficiency mode and provide a link to the settings panel.

The user will be able to disable these notifications in the settings panel.
