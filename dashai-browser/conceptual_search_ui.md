# Conceptual UI Elements for AI-Enhanced Search & Discovery

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the AI-Enhanced Search & Discovery feature in DashAIBrowser.

## Omnibox Integration

The omnibox will be enhanced to provide dynamic, context-aware suggestions as the user types. These suggestions will go beyond simple autocomplete and will be based on the user's current context, browsing history, and real-time trends.

When the user starts typing in the omnibox, a dropdown will appear with a list of suggestions. The suggestions will be grouped into categories, such as:

*   **Search:** Traditional search suggestions based on the user's query.
*   **History:** Suggestions from the user's browsing history that are relevant to the query.
*   **Recommendations:** AI-powered recommendations for web pages, articles, and other content that may be of interest to the user.
*   **Actions:** Actions that the user can take directly from the omnibox, such as "Translate this page" or "Summarize this article."

## Multimodal Search Icon

A small camera icon will be displayed in the omnibox. When the user clicks this icon, a dialog will appear where they can upload an image or provide a URL to an image.

When the user provides an image, the `RequestMultimodalSearch` RPC will be called to perform a search based on the image. The search results will be displayed in a new tab.

## Discovery Feed Sidebar

A new sidebar will be added to the DashAIBrowser UI. This sidebar will be called the "Discovery Feed."

The Discovery Feed will display a list of AI-driven content recommendations. The recommendations will be based on the user's browsing history, interests, and real-time trends.

The user will be able to customize the Discovery Feed by providing feedback on the recommendations.

## Semantic History Dashboard

The browsing history page will be redesigned to provide a more intuitive and powerful way to explore the user's browsing history.

The new Semantic History Dashboard will allow the user to:

*   Search their browsing history using natural language queries.
*   Visualize their browsing journeys as a graph.
*   Discover new content based on their browsing history.
