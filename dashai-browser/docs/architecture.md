# DashAIBrowser Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the DashAIBrowser architecture.

## Core Components

DashAIBrowser is built on top of a Chromium/Blink fork and is composed of the following core components:

*   **Browser Core:** The core browser functionality, including the rendering engine, networking stack, and security sandbox.
*   **AI Services Orchestration Layer (ASOL):** A C++ backend that acts as an intermediary between the browser core and the EchoSphere AI-vCPU.
*   **EchoSphere AI-vCPU:** A sophisticated AI engine that provides a wide range of advanced capabilities.
*   **Mojo IPC:** A high-performance inter-process communication (IPC) system that is used for communication between the browser core and the ASOL.
*   **Prometheus Protocol:** An AI prompt engineering system that is used to create and manage the AI models that are used in DashAIBrowser.

## Communication Flow

1.  The user interacts with an AI-powered feature in the browser UI.
2.  The browser core sends a request to the ASOL via Mojo IPC.
3.  The ASOL receives the request and forwards it to the EchoSphere AI-vCPU.
4.  The EchoSphere AI-vCPU processes the request and returns a response to the ASOL.
5.  The ASOL forwards the response to the browser core via Mojo IPC.
6.  The browser core displays the response to the user in the UI.
