# DashAIBrowser Roadmap

This document outlines the future development phases of DashAIBrowser.

## Phase 1: Browser UI Integration & End-to-End Validation

The next major phase of DashAIBrowser development will focus on integrating the powerful AI capabilities directly into the browser's user interface. This is where the "AI co-pilot" truly becomes tangible and interactive for the end-user.

**Objective:** To integrate the ASOL-powered AI features into DashAIBrowser's user interface, creating a fully interactive and demonstrable prototype.

**Key Tasks (High-Level):**

1.  **Implement Browser UI Elements:** Develop the actual visual components (buttons, sidebars, overlays, contextual menus) for each AI feature (e.g., "Spark" icon for summarization, "Jules Assistant" sidebar, "Content Integrity Score" indicator).
2.  **Connect UI to Mojo Clients:** Implement the browser-side C++ logic to detect user interactions, gather relevant page context, and make RPC calls to the ASOL via the defined Mojo interfaces.
3.  **Dynamic UI Adaptation Logic:** Implement browser-side code to interpret `UIAdaptationDirective` messages from ASOL and dynamically modify the browser's rendering and layout (e.g., reconfigure toolbars, adjust sidebar visibility, change notification styles).
4.  **Comprehensive End-to-End Integration Testing:** Develop rigorous tests that simulate user interaction within the browser UI and verify the full pipeline: UI -> Mojo -> ASOL -> (Conceptual) AI-vCPU/Prometheus Protocol -> ASOL -> Mojo -> UI. This will involve advanced testing frameworks for browser UI automation.
5.  **Performance & Responsiveness Tuning:** Optimize the UI integration for minimal latency and maximum responsiveness, ensuring AI assistance feels instantaneous.

**Crucial Acknowledgment:** This phase involves deep interaction with Chromium's complex frontend rendering pipeline (e.g., using `views`, `web_contents`, `devtools` APIs). It is a significant undertaking that will require specialized expertise in Chromium's internal architecture.

## Phase 2: Public Beta

Once the browser UI is fully integrated and tested, we will launch a public beta of DashAIBrowser. The beta will be open to a limited number of users, and we will gather feedback to help us improve the browser.

## Phase 3: Public Release

After the public beta, we will launch the public release of DashAIBrowser. The public release will be available to everyone, and we will continue to add new features and improve the browser over time.
