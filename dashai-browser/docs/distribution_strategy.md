# Distribution Strategy

This document outlines the conceptual distribution strategy for DashAIBrowser.

## Build Artifacts

The final build artifacts will be:

*   **Windows:** An MSI installer.
*   **macOS:** A DMG image.
*   **Linux:** A DEB package for Debian-based distributions and an RPM package for Red Hat-based distributions.
*   **Android:** An APK file.
*   **iOS:** An IPA file.

## Release Channels

We will have the following release channels:

*   **Stable:** The most recent stable release of DashAIBrowser.
*   **Beta:** The most recent beta release of DashAIBrowser.
*   **Dev:** The most recent development build of DashAIBrowser.

## Update Mechanisms

The browser will automatically check for updates and will prompt the user to install them.

## Cross-Platform Considerations

The browser will be built using a cross-platform framework, such as Chromium, to ensure that it can be easily ported to different platforms.

## WebAssembly/Containerization

We will use WebAssembly to run third-party code in a sandboxed environment. This will allow us to safely run untrusted code without compromising the security of the browser.

We will also use containerization to package the browser and its dependencies. This will make it easy to deploy the browser to different environments.
