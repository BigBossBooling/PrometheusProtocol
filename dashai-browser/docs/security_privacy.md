# Security & Privacy

This document provides a deep dive into the security and privacy features of DashAIBrowser.

## AI-Driven Threat Detection & Prevention

*   **Proactive Threat Mitigation:** The **Stream_Core** monitors your browsing activity in real time and sends any suspicious activity to the **Logic_Processor** for analysis. If a threat is detected, the browser will take immediate action to mitigate it. This includes blocking malicious websites, preventing drive-by downloads, and warning you about phishing attacks.
*   **AI-Powered Phishing Detection:** The **Logic_Processor** uses machine learning to identify and block phishing attacks. It analyzes the content of web pages, the URLs, and other factors to determine whether a page is likely to be a phishing page.
*   **Malware and Scam Protection:** The browser uses a combination of blacklists and heuristics to protect you from malware and scams. It also uses machine learning to identify new and emerging threats.

## Granular Privacy Controls & AI-Assisted Consent

*   **DID-Based AI Interaction:** The browser uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for decentralized identity management. This means that you are in control of your own identity and you do not have to rely on a centralized authority to verify your identity.
*   **AI-Assisted Consent:** The **Logic_Processor** analyzes privacy policies and provides you with a clear and concise summary of how your data is being used. This helps you make informed decisions about who you share your data with.
*   **Privacy-Preserving AI:** The browser uses a variety of privacy-preserving techniques to protect your data. These techniques include differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption.

## AI-Assisted dApp Contract Analysis

*   **Security Vulnerability Detection:** The **Logic_Processor** analyzes decentralized application (dApp) contracts to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This helps you avoid interacting with malicious or insecure dApps.
*   **Gas Price Prediction:** The browser uses machine learning to predict gas prices on the Ethereum network. This helps you save money on transaction fees.
*   **Transaction Simulation:** The browser allows you to simulate transactions before you send them. This helps you avoid making mistakes that could cost you money.
