# Conceptual Integration Test Scenario

This document describes a conceptual end-to-end test scenario for the integration of Prometheus Protocol with DashAIBrowser.

## Scenario

1.  A user opens the DashAIBrowser DevTools and navigates to the "Prompt Engineering" panel.
2.  The user creates a new prompt template with the following content: "Translate the following text to French: {{text}}"
3.  The user saves the prompt template with the ID "translate-to-french".
4.  The user opens a web page with a text field and enters the text "Hello, world!".
5.  The user clicks the "Generate with AI" button in the AI-Assisted Content Creation Toolbar.
6.  The user selects the "translate-to-french" prompt template and provides the value "Hello, world!" for the `text` variable.
7.  The user clicks the "Generate" button.
8.  The DashAIBrowser frontend sends a `GenerateOptimizedPrompt` request to the ASOL backend.
9.  The ASOL backend forwards the request to the Prometheus Protocol backend.
10. The Prometheus Protocol backend generates the prompt "Translate the following text to French: Hello, world!".
11. The Prometheus Protocol backend returns the generated prompt to the ASOL backend.
12. The ASOL backend returns the generated prompt to the DashAIBrowser frontend.
13. The DashAIBrowser frontend inserts the generated prompt into the text field.
14. The user submits the form, and the text "Translate the following text to French: Hello, world!" is sent to an LLM.
15. The LLM returns the translation "Bonjour, le monde!".
16. The user is satisfied with the translation and clicks the "thumbs up" icon next to the translated text.
17. The DashAIBrowser frontend sends a `SubmitPromptFeedback` request to the ASOL backend with a high satisfaction score.
18. The ASOL backend forwards the request to the Prometheus Protocol backend.
19. The Prometheus Protocol backend records the feedback.
20. The next time a user uses the "translate-to-french" prompt template, the `OptimizationAgent` will take the positive feedback into account.
