# Conceptual UI Elements for AI-Driven Content Curation

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the AI-Driven Content Curation feature in DashAIBrowser.

## "Content Integrity Score" Indicator

A subtle icon, such as a shield or a rating, will be displayed in the address bar or next to search results. This icon will indicate the AI's assessment of a page's trustworthiness and quality.

The icon will be color-coded to provide a quick visual cue:

*   **Green:** The content is likely to be trustworthy and of high quality.
*   **Yellow:** The content may be biased or of mixed quality.
*   **Red:** The content is likely to be untrustworthy or of low quality.

The user will be able to hover over the icon to see a more detailed breakdown of the content integrity score, including information about the author's reputation, the publisher's history, and the presence of any logical fallacies or biases.

## "Filter Content" / "Curation Settings" Button

A new button will be added to the toolbar or a sidebar that allows the user to configure their content preferences. When the user clicks this button, a dialog will appear where they can:

*   **Prioritize factual content:** The user can choose to prioritize content from sources that have a proven track record of accuracy.
*   **Filter for bias:** The user can choose to filter out content that is likely to be biased or one-sided.
*   **Show diverse perspectives:** The user can choose to see a variety of perspectives on a given topic, even if some of those perspectives are controversial.

## AI-Generated Counter-Arguments/Perspectives

When the browser detects that a user is reading a potentially biased article, it will display a discreet pop-up or sidebar element with AI-generated counter-arguments or alternative perspectives.

This feature is designed to help users avoid filter bubbles and to encourage them to think critically about the information they are consuming.

## AI-Filtered Feeds

The AI-Driven Content Curation feature will be integrated with news feeds and social media streams. This will allow users to apply their content preferences to the content they see in these feeds.

For example, a user could choose to filter out all content from a particular source, or to only see content that has been fact-checked by a trusted third party.
