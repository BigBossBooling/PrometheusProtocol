# Conceptual UI Elements for AI-Powered Collaborative Browsing

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the AI-Powered Collaborative Browsing feature in DashAIBrowser.

## "Share Session" Button

A "Share Session" button will be added to the browser toolbar. When a user clicks this button, a dialog will appear where they can invite other users to join the session.

The user can invite other users by providing their email addresses or by generating a shareable link. The user can also invite AI personas from Project Doppelganger to join the session.

## Participant List/Avatars

A new sidebar will be added to the DashAIBrowser UI. This sidebar will display a list of the participants in the current collaborative session.

Each participant will be represented by their avatar. Human users will have their profile pictures as their avatars, while AI personas will have their own unique avatars.

The sidebar will also display the current status of each participant, such as whether they are online or offline.

## AI-Powered Annotation/Highlighting

Users will be able to highlight text and other elements on the page. The highlights will be visible to all participants in the session.

When a user highlights a piece of text, an AI-powered assistant will automatically provide a summary of the highlighted text. The summary will be displayed in a pop-up window.

Users will also be able to add their own annotations to the highlights. The annotations will be visible to all participants in the session.

## Real-time Summary Panel

A new panel will be added to the DashAIBrowser UI. This panel will display a real-time summary of the current group activity and discussion points.

The summary will be generated by an AI-powered assistant. The assistant will analyze the group's activity and discussion and generate a concise summary of the key points.

## AI-Mediated Discussion Channels

A chat interface will be integrated into the DashAIBrowser UI. The chat interface will allow participants in the collaborative session to communicate with each other.

An AI-powered assistant will be available in the chat interface. The assistant will be able to:

*   Summarize the discussion.
*   Mediate conflicts.
*   Suggest topics for discussion.
*   Answer questions.
