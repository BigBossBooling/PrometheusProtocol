# Conceptual UI Elements for Adaptive UI/UX

This document describes the conceptual UI elements for the Adaptive UI/UX feature in DashAIBrowser.

## Dynamic Toolbar Layouts

The browser toolbar will dynamically adapt to the user's current context. For example:

*   When the user is on a long article, a "Summarize" button will appear in the toolbar.
*   When the user is on a social media site, buttons for sharing and composing posts will be prominently displayed.
*   When the user is in a development environment, buttons for debugging and inspecting code will be available.

The user will also be able to create their own custom toolbar layouts and associate them with specific contexts.

## Adaptive Sidebar Content

The sidebar will dynamically change its content based on the user's current task. For example:

*   When the user is typing in a text field, the "AI Assistant" sidebar will appear, providing suggestions and assistance with writing.
*   When the user is idle, the "Discovery Feed" sidebar will appear, providing personalized content recommendations.
*   When the user is on a shopping website, a "Price Tracker" sidebar will appear, showing the price history of the current product.

## Context-Aware Notification Styles

Notifications will adapt their urgency and intrusiveness based on the user's current focus and cognitive state. For example:

*   If the user is in a meeting, notifications will be displayed discreetly and without sound.
*   If the user is working on a time-sensitive task, notifications will be more prominent and may include an audible alert.
*   If the user is feeling overwhelmed, notifications will be suppressed to reduce cognitive load.

## Personalized Theme and Color Adjustments

The browser theme and color palette will subtly shift based on environmental lighting and user fatigue. For example:

*   If the user is in a dark environment, the browser will switch to a dark theme to reduce eye strain.
*   If the user has been working for a long time, the browser will adjust the color palette to be more calming and less stimulating.
