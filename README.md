# Prometheus Protocol: Engineering Intent

Prometheus Protocol is a sophisticated software project designed to transform the act of prompting Artificial Intelligence into a precise, architected science. It aims to empower users to extract the highest statistically positive variable of best likely outcomes from Google's cutting-edge "Jules" platform.

This project serves as the foundational framework for "Prometheus Protocol: Engineering Intent â€“ Josephis K. Wade's Blueprint for AI Mastery in Google Jules."

## Vision

To build the ultimate "software prompt creation" environment for the next generation of AI collaboration, streamlining, optimizing, and elevating the entire prompt creation lifecycle.

## Core Principles

The development of Prometheus Protocol is guided by the **Expanded KISS Principle**:

*   **K** - Know Your Core, Keep it Clear
*   **I** - Iterate Intelligently, Integrate Intuitively
*   **S** - Systematize for Scalability, Synchronize for Synergy
*   **S** - Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution
*   **S** - Stimulate Engagement, Sustain Impact

This repository contains the source code and ongoing development of the Prometheus Protocol.
